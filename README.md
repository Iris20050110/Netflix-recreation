# Netflix Recreation

## Overview

Hello! Thank you for checking out this git repository for a clone of the Netflix Website! This app mainly focuses on recreating the frontend features of Netflix. If you would like to learn more, please feel to reach out: yushanli0110@g.ucla.edu

## Setup

This project used TMDB (https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US) as the movie database and was bootstrapped with [React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:
```
npm start
```
or
```
yarn start
```
The app runs in the development mode. You can open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

```
npm run build
```
or
```
yarn build
```
This builds the app for production by generating the build folder. Now the app would be ready for deployment.
